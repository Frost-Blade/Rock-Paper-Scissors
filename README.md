# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A rock, paper and scissors game that takes a user input between the three. The computer then generates a random choice between rock, paper and scissors. The game will then compare the user input to the random generated choice from the computer.

This is the 3rd exercise/program/game I made when I was learning C# (10-14-2023)
